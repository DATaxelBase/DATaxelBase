ðŸ‘‹ Hello everybody, </br>
*So let's start analysis on :taxi: `NYC Taxi Trip Duration `:taxi:*
Let's follow the plan :point_down:

## Problem Definition
We want to predict the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City.</br>
<p align = "center"> <img  src = "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/518657226/fr/photo/les-taxis-sur-7th-avenue-at-times-square-new-york-city.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=QFtPEFxdprKsybWaYPYmMbogJx3svfMnuOQ67NBtUSA=" alt = "New York City Taxi">
</p>

Taxi company wants us to predict the duration of each trip at the point when the trip start. Now , why would NYC taxi company be interested in this? Because this help them plan their fleet in a much better manner. 


## Hypothesis Generation
*:thinking: What factors could impact Taxi trip?*
Let's separate context on:
- Environment
> Does the condition of the road affect the duration of the trip?</br>Does the weather affect the duration of trip?</br>Is the trip faster at night or during the day?

- Demographic
> Does the size of population groups in neighborhood affect the duration trip?

- Customer
> Does the number of passengers affect the duration trip? </br>Does the destination of passengers affect the taxi duration trip?</br>Does the distance between locations affect duration trip?

- Others
> Does the traffic at certain hours of day affect the duration trip?
