ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DATaxelBase
After a few months, I am finally available to travel with you on many projects. This project will help you discover all the intricacies of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and pursue machine learning for prediction. :smile:

**The following plan will be applied to all projects:**
1. Problem Definition
2. Hypothesis Generation
3. Data Extraction /Collection
4. Data Exploration and Transformation
5. Predictive Modeling
6. Model Deployement/Implementation

In the first notebook, you will find the four first sections, the second will cover the prediction part. Are you ready?:nerd_face:</br>
So our first project has been :taxi: `NYC Taxi Trip Duration `:taxi:. Hope you had enjoyed it.
Now I will add progressively the projects each week. The new challenge is to cover at least 2 datasets per week, feel free to write me by mail if you want to propose any project or collaborate.
For further projects, go into my DATaxelBase :relaxed:

**Summary of projects coverd :**
1. NYC Taxi Trip Duration
2. Titanic Survival next week (^-^) 
âœ¨Welcome again. Hope you will enjoy.âœ¨:wink:

DATaxelBase/DATaxelBase next challenge, great dataset (^-^). Let's going on
