ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DATaxelBase
After a few months, I am finally available to travel with you on many projects. This project will help you discover all the intricacies of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and pursue machine learning for prediction. :smile:

**The following plan will be applied to all projects:**
1. Problem Definition
2. Hypothesis Generation
3. Data Extraction /Collection
4. Data Exploration and Transformation
5. Predictive Modeling
6. Model Deployement/Implementation

In the first notebook, you will find the four first sections, the second will cover the prediction part. Are you ready?:nerd_face:</br>
So our first project will be :taxi: `NYC Taxi Trip Duration `:taxi:.
For further projects, go into my DATaxelBase :relaxed:

âœ¨Welcome again. Hope you will enjoy.âœ¨:wink:
